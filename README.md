# tranzmeoProject
The project contains 5 questions.
1.Write a python code to find the latitude and longitude coordinates that are out of line and
automatically fix the same to form a continuous path.
2. From the given terrain list with kilometeres, write a python script to generate DB of each
latitude and longitude pair with matching terrain information (NB: take the starting
latitude and longitude and 0 KM and end as )
3. Write Query to list all the points with terrain “road” in it without “civil station”
4. Generate a set of points which are 25 meters to the left and right of the given latitude
and longitude, Use multi-threaded/ multi-processing to optimize the execution with the
reasoning of the same
5. Design a data structure that can, efficiently with respect to time used, store and check if the
total of any three successively added elements is equal to a given total.

I have used math library for the calculation for the distance from one place to another. This distance is used to find the continous path.
Xampp is used for the database. The datas are saved to database by using pymysql library in python.
Given a GUI.py for the working of full questions in a Graphical User Interface.
